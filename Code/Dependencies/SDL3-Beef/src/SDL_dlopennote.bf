 *
 * This header allows you to annotate your code so external tools know about
 * dynamic shared library dependencies.
 *
 * If you determine that your toolchain doesn't support dlopen notes, you can
 * disable this feature by defining `SDL_DISABLE_DLOPEN_NOTES`. You can use
 * this CMake snippet to check for support:
 *
 * ```cmake
 * include(CheckCSourceCompiles)
 * find_package(SDL3 REQUIRED CONFIG COMPONENTS Headers)
 * list(APPEND CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES SDL3::Headers)
 * check_c_source_compiles([==[
 *   #include <SDL3/SDL_dlopennote.h>
 *   SDL_ELF_NOTE_DLOPEN("sdl-video",
 *     "Support for video through SDL",
 *     SDL_ELF_NOTE_DLOPEN_PRIORITY_SUGGESTED,
 *     "libSDL-1.2.so.0", "libSDL-2.0.so.0", "libSDL3.so.0"
 *   )
 *   int32 main(int32 argc, char8* argv[]) {
 *     return argc + argv[0][1];
 *   }
 * ]==] COMPILER_SUPPORTS_SDL_ELF_NOTE_DLOPEN)
