.SH NAME
MIX_ResumeTrack \- Resume a currently-paused track\[char46]
.SH HEADER FILE
Defined in SDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer\[char46]h

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include \(dqSDL3_mixer/SDL_mixer.h\(dq
.PP
.BI "bool MIX_ResumeTrack(MIX_Track *track);
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A paused track is not considered "stopped," so its

.BR MIX_TrackStoppedCallback
 will not fire if
paused, but it won't change state by default, generate audio, or generally
make progress, until it is resumed\[char46]

It is legal to resume a track that's in any state (playing, paused, or
stopped)\[char46] Unless the track is currently paused, resuming does nothing, and
returns true\[char46] A false return is only used to signal errors here (such as

.BR MIX_Init
 not being called or
.BR track
being NULL)\[char46]

.SH FUNCTION PARAMETERS
.TP
.I track
the track to resume\[char46]
.SH RETURN VALUE
Returns true if the track has resumed, false on error; call
SDL_GetError() for details\[char46]

.SH THREAD SAFETY
It is safe to call this function from any thread\[char46]

.SH AVAILABILITY
This function is available since SDL_mixer 3\[char46]0\[char46]0\[char46]

.SH SEE ALSO
